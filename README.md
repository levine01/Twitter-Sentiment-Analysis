## Overview
This project aims to analyze Twitter sentiment regarding Apple and Google products using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content, helping to understand public sentiment towards these technology giants.

##  Business Understanding

###  Introduction

In the realm of technology giants, Apple and Google, public sentiment plays a pivotal role in shaping their strategies and brand perception. This analysis focuses on understanding the dynamics of sentiment expressed on Twitter concerning these companies. Apple and Google have a significant global presence and are influenced by various factors, including product launches and developments. Last year, Apple's revenue exceeded 300 billion USD, while Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported revenues of over 181 billion USD. Monitoring and leveraging public sentiment can provide valuable insights for both companies in guiding marketing strategies and product development decisions.

### Problem Statement

The challenge at hand is to harness the amount of sentiment data from Twitter and convert it into actionable insights for Apple and Google. This analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in sentiment fluctuations concerning these companies. Detecting spikes in sentiment and identifying their underlying causes can enable more informed decision-making, whether it involves addressing product issues or capitalizing on positive public perception.

### Objectives

#### Main Ojective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze Twitter sentiment data related to Apple and Google comprehensively. By doing so, we intend to provide stakeholders within these organizations with valuable insights into the ebb and flow of public sentiment. Understanding when and why sentiment shifts occur can guide product development strategies, marketing campaigns, and brand management.

#### Specific Objectives

### Metric of success

The success of our project hinges on its ability to extract meaningful insights from Twitter sentiment data. Our evaluation metric will include the effectiveness of identifying sentiment spikes, trends in sentiment over time, and the correlation between sentiment and significant events, such as product launches or controversies. Additionally, the project's impact on informing data-driven decision-making within Apple and Google will be a key measure of success.

##  Data Understanding
The dataset originates from CrowdFlower, accessed via data.world. The choice of this dataset is highly suitable for our project's objectives. It contains over 9,000 tweets that have been manually rated for sentiment (positive, negative, or neither). These tweets serve as a valuable resource for training and testing our sentiment analysis models. Since Twitter is a prominent platform for users to express their opinions and sentiments publicly, this data represents real-world sentiment effectively.

The dataset is sufficiently large, comprising over 9,000 tweets, which ensures an ample amount of data for model training and validation. The features used in our analysis have been carefully selected based on their properties and relevance to the project's objectives. Features such as tweet_text and emotion toward a brand or product are integral to understanding sentiment and determining the factors influencing it.

While the dataset is valuable, it does have limitations that could impact our analysis. For instance, tweet sentiment is not always straightforward to discern, as it may depend on context, sarcasm, or language nuances. Additionally, the dataset may not be fully representative of all sentiments expressed on Twitter.
